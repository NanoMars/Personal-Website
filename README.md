This is a website to showcase projects in a scalable way I made for [Hack Club Arcade](https://hackclub.com/arcade/). Github Copilot was used to aid in the creation of this project.

(although I am studying with UNE, this is a subject through open universities AU to replace regular schooling for highschool as I am homeschooled.)
