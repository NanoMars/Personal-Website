            <p>Me and my father founded an FTC team who I built my first competition robot with.</p>
            <p>The robot was co-designed with my team, and I did all of the cad.</p>
            <p>The robot had an arm that moved up and down and extended, controlled by a spool, attached to it was a roller intake system for the pixels.</p>
            <p>in total the robot took 3 months of dedicated work to complete; and work continued into competition day.</p>
